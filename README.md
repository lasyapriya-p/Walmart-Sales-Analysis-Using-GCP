# Walmart-Sales-Analysis-Using-GCP

The goal of the Walmart sales analysis project is to create an effective system that can manage the massive amount of data generated on Black Friday and facilitate strategic choices.

🌟 Here's my "Walmart Sales Analysis"! Developed with Python, BigQuery, Cloud Functions, GCP Pub/Sub, and Google Looker Studio.

🔍  Here's the breakdown:

💻 Python Charm: creating real inventory updates and sales transactions, and then publishing them to Pub/Sub topics.

🔀 Pub/Sub: Sharing information across several Pub/Sub topics, each of which turns on a specific Cloud Function.

🛠️Cloud services: involve responding to Pub/Sub events and importing data into BigQuery for in-depth analysis by extracting and integrating it from the stream using a Python script.

📈Real-time inventory administration : involves updating inventory data in real-time upon trade generation to ensure synced stock levels and greater sales analysis.

📉 Google Looker Studio : Using Google Looker Studio to visualise data, sales comparisons are shown  with dynamic visualisations for insights that can be used for further Decision making.
